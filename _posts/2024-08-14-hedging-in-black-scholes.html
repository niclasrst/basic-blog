    Recall that we are working with derivative securities that are of the form
    \[H = h(S_T), \qquad \text{for a measurable map}\; h.\]
    In particular the derivative security only depends on the price of the stock \(S\) at time \(T\).
    Moreover, recall that in the article about the BSM equation we have seen that
    \[dK(t, S_t) = \sigma S_t K_s(t, S_t)dW_t^{\mathbb{Q}}\]
    This implies that the process \((K(t, S_t))_t\) is a \(\mathbb{Q}\)-Martingale.

    Using these previous results, we apply the martingale representation theorem to \(K(t, S_t)\):
    \[\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{Q}}[h(S_T)\;\vert\;\mathcal{F}_t] = K(t, S_t) = \underbrace{K(0,
    S_0)}_{=\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{Q}}[h(S_T)]} + \int_0^t \sigma S_u K_s(u, S_u)dW_u^{\mathbb{Q}}.\]
    If we now take a hedging strategy \((\pi_0, \pi)\), we must have
    \[\widetilde{V}_t^\pi = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\frac{h(S_T)}{B_T} \;\vert\; \mathcal{F}_t\right] =
    e^{-rT}\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{Q}}[h(S_T)] + \sigma \int_0^t e^{-rT}K_s(u, S_u)S_udW_u^{\mathbb{Q}}.\]
    Equivalently, by looking at the dynamics, we have
    \[d\widetilde{V}_t^\pi = \sigma e^{-rT} K_s(t, S_t) S_t dW_t^{\mathbb{Q}}.\]

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    By the self-financing nature of a hedging-strategy, we further deduce that
    \[d\widetilde{V}_t^\pi = d\widetilde{G}_t^\pi = \sigma e^{-rt} \pi(t)dW_t^{\mathbb{Q}}.\]
    But as the martingale representation theorem comes with a statement of uniqueness, we must have
    \[\sigma e^{-rT} K_s(t, S_t)S_t = \sigma e^{-rt} \pi(t) \qquad \lambda\vert_{[0,T]} \otimes \mathbb{P}\text{-a.s.}\]
    and by solving the equation for \(\pi(t)\), we retrieve the risky part
    \[\pi(t) = e^{-r(T - t)} K_s(t, S_t) S_t = F_s(t, S_t) S_t.\]
    Finally, since the strategy \((\pi_0, \pi)\) is self-financing, we can deduce on the formula for \(\pi_0\):
    \[\pi_0(t) = V_t^\pi - \pi(t) = e^{-r(T-t)} K(t, S_t) - F_s(t, S_t) S_t = F(t, S_t) - F_s(t, S_t) S_t.\]

    Thus, to conclude, if we are able to solve the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we not only know the fair price of a
    derivative security but also a suitable hedging strategy.
    Although, solving the BSM equation is a challenge on its own.
