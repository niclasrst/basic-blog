title: "The dimension of algebraic varieties"
date: 2024-10-11
abstract: "I want to give a brief introduction to the concept of dimension of algebraic varieties.
We will define the topological dimension of a variety (or more general of a topological space) and it will turn out that
in the case of an algebraic variety, we can describe the dimension of a
variety in purely algebraic terms."

<p class="Section">1&ensp;Topological and algebraic dimension</p>
<p class="BodyText Justified">
    Let us start by introducing the concept of dimension for arbitrary topological spaces.
</p>

<div class="definition BodyText">&ensp;
    Let \(X \neq \emptyset\) be a topological space.
    The number
    \[\text{dim}(X) := \sup\{n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \;\vert\; \emptyset \subsetneq X_0 \subsetneq X_1 \subsetneq \cdots
    \subsetneq X_n \text{ is a chain of irred. and closed subspaces of } X\}\]
    is called the <b>Krull dimension</b> of \(X\).
</div>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    Recall, that a topological space is irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper closed subsets,
    i.e.
    there are no two closed subsets \(A, B \subset X\) such that \(X = A \cup B\) and \(X \neq A, B\).
    <br><br>
    In similar fashion, we can make the notion of dimension available to algebraic objects, namely rings.
</p>

<div class="BodyText definition">&ensp;
    Let \(R\) be a ring and \(\mathfrak{p}\trianglelefteq R\) a prime ideal.
    <ol class="Enumerate">
        <li>
            The height of \(\mathfrak{p}\) is given by
            \[\text{ht}(\mathfrak{p}) := \sup\{n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \;\vert\; \mathfrak{p}_0 \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_1
            \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_n = \mathfrak{p} \text{ is a chain of prime ideals in } R\}.\]
        </li>
        <li>
            The Krull dimension of \(R\) is then defined as
            \[\text{dim}(R) := \sup\{\text{ht}(\mathfrak{p}) \;\vert\; \mathfrak{p}\trianglelefteq R \text{ prime}\}.\]
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="BodyText proposition">&ensp;
    Let \(k\) be a field.
    <ol class="Enumerate">
        <li>
            For every affine algebra, we have that
            \[\text{dim}(A) = \text{dim}(\text{Specm}(A)).\]
        </li>
        <li>
            If \(k\) is algebraically closed, then for every affine algebraic variety \(V \subseteq \mathbb{A}^n(k)\) it
            holds that
            \[\text{dim}(V) = \text{dim}(k[V]).\]
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class="BodyText Justified proof">
    <ol class="Enumerate">
        <li>
            This follows directly from the definitions by using the fact that the irreducible, Zariski-closed subsets of
            the maximal spectrum \(\text{Specm}(A)\) are in bijection to the prime ideals of \(A\).
        </li>
        <li>
            This is an immediate consequence of 1. by setting \(A = k[V]\).
            To elaborate a bit more on this, as the field \(k\) is algebraically closed, the maximal ideals of \(k[V]\)
            are in bijection to the points of \(V\).
            Hence, the maximal Spectrum \(\text{Specm}(k[V])\) is isomorphic to \(V\).<span id="QED"></span>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    To get interesting results and even calculate the dimensions of what one would consider 'simple' varieties (e.g. the
    standard affine plane \(\mathbb{A}^n(k)\)), we need more algebraic machinery.
    But before we introduce these tools, let us give some basic examples.
</p>

<div class="BodyText Justified example">&ensp;
    <ol class="Enumerate">
        <li>
            For any Hausdorff space \(X\), we have that \(\text{dim}(X) = 0\).
            This is due to the fact that the only irreducible subsets of a Hausdorff space are the singletons.
        </li>
        <li>
            For \(k\) an infinite field, we have that \(\text{dim}(\mathbb{A}^1(k)) = 1\).
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p class="Section">2&ensp;Algebraic tools</p>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    To underline the importance of such tools, consider a chain of prime ideals as follows
    \[\langle 0\rangle = \mathfrak{p}_0 \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_d
    \quad\text{
    in}\quad k[X_1, \ldots, X_n].\]
    Then, by factoring out \(\mathfrak{p}_1\) one gets a chain of prime ideals of length \(d-1\) in \(k[X_1, \ldots,
    X_n] / \mathfrak{p}_1\), but there is no reason for the existence of an isomorphism between \(k[X_1, \ldots,
    X_n]/\mathfrak{p}_1\) and \(k[X_1, \ldots, X_{n-1}]\).
    Thus, not even the dimension of the standard affine spaces can be deduced via induction from the case \(n=1\).
    The central concept to overcome this issue is the notion of an integral ring extension.
    <br><br>
    <i>
        Reminder: a ring extension \(S/R\) is called integral, if every element of \(S\) is integral.
        That is, every element is the root of a monic polynomial (i.e. a polynomial with leading coefficient equal to
        1).
    </i>
    <br><br>
    As the goal of this little post is to give a brief introduction to the concept of a dimension for algebraic
    varieties,
    we won't give proofs for most of the following results.
    For the interested reader, all the proofs should be contained in any standard textbook on commutative algebra.
</p>

<div class="BodyText theorem">&ensp;
    Let \(S/R\) be an integral ring extension.
    Then \(\text{dim }S = \text{dim } R\) holds.

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    Above theorem is a consequence of one of the theorems of Cohen-Seidenberg, often reffered to as the 'going-up'
    theorem.
    A second result of Cohen-Seidenberg is the 'going-down' theorem, which allows us to deduce that the dimension of the
    polynomial ring \(k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]\) is precisely \(n\), what we were hoping for.
    We collect this with another result in the following theorem.
</p>

<div class="BodyText theorem">&ensp;
    <ol class="Enumerate">
        <li>
            Noether-normalization: Every finitely generated \(k\)-algebra \(A\) is an integral ring extension of a
            polynomial ring \(k[X_1,
            \ldots, X_n]\).
        </li>
        <li>
            Noether-normalization (deluxe): Let \(I \trianglelefteq A\) be an ideal.
            Then, the \(X_1, \ldots, X_n\) in \(A\) can be chosen such that \(I \cap k[X_1, \ldots, X_n] = \langle
            X_{\delta + 1}, \ldots, X_n \rangle\) for \(\delta \leq n\).

    The goal for the rest of this post is to calculate the dimension of a hyperplane (a affine variety defined by a
    single irreducible polynomial).
    Before we do so, we want to give a quick excursion on the dimension of quasi-projective varieties, i.e. open subsets
    of projective varieties.
</p>

<p class="Section">3&ensp;Dimension of quasi-projective varieties</p>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    As the coordinate ring of a projective variety 'remembers the embedding' (there is a choice of basis) we have to
    take a slightly different approach, we will use the function field of the variety.
</p>

<div class="BodyText definition">&ensp;
    Let \(K/k\) be a field extension, then
    \[\text{trdeg}_k (K) := \sup\{n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \;\vert\; \exists\;n \text{ algebraically independent elements over
    } k
    \text{ in } K\}\]
    is called the transcendence degree of \(K\) over \(k\).
</div>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    The following theorem now relates this concept to the dimension of a quasi-projective variety.
</p>

<div class="BodyText theorem">
    Let \(k\) be algebraically closed, \(V \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n(k)\) a quasi-projective variety.
    Then \[\text{dim } V = \text{trdeg}_k\; k(V).\]
    <i>Here, \(k(V)\) denotes the function field of \(V\).</i>
</div>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    Another interesting incidence we want to mention is the following.
</p>

<p class="BodyText proposition">
    Let \(V \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n(k)\) be an irreducible quasi-projective variety and \(x \in V\).
    Then \[\text{dim }V = \text{dim }\mathcal{O}_{V, x}.\]
    <i>Here, \(\mathcal{O}_{V,x}\) denotes the local ring of \(V\) in the point \(x\).</i>
</p>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    This last result states that the dimension of a quasi-projective variety is the same as the dimension of its local
    ring.
    Hence, the dimension of a quasi-projective variety (at least of an irreducible one) is a <b>local</b> property!
</p>

<p class="Section">4&ensp;The dimension of a hyperplane.</p>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    Finally, we will calculate the dimension of a hyperplane in \(\mathbb{A}^n(k)\).
    An important result we need for this is the following.
</p>

<div class="BodyText Justified theorem">&ensp;
    Let \(A\) be a finitely generated \(k\)-algebra with no zero divisors.
    Then, all maximal chains of prime ideals in \(A\) have the same length.
</div>

<p class="BodyText Justified">
    Now the proof is in two steps.
    We will proof a more general result and deduce our claim from it.
</p>

<div class="BodyText theorem">&ensp;
    Let \(V \subseteq \mathbb{A}^n(k)\) be an irreducible affine variety and \(k\) algebraically closed.
    <ol class="Enumerate">
        <li>
            \(\text{dim }V + \text{ht}(I(V)) = n\)
        </li>
        <li>
            If \(V = V(f)\) for \(f \in k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]\) irreducible, then \(\text{dim }V = n-1\).
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class="BodyText Justified proof">
    <ol class="Enumerate">
        <li>
            Since \(V\) is irreducible, its vanishing ideal \(I(V)\) is a prime ideal.
            So, let \[\langle 0\rangle \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_d\]
            be a maximal chain of prime ideals in \(k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]\) with \(I(V) = \mathfrak{p}_i\) for an i.
            Then, by the theorem above, we have that \(d = \text{dim }k[X_1, \ldots, X_n] = n\) and \(i =
            \text{ht}(I(V))\).
            <br><br>
            Moreover, we have that
            \[\langle 0\rangle \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_{i+1}/\mathfrak{p}_i \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq
            \mathfrak{p}_n/\mathfrak{p}_i\]
            is a maximal chain of prime ideals in \(k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/\mathfrak{p}_i = k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I(V)\).
            Thus, we have that \[\text{dim }V = n - i = n - \text{ht}(I(V)) \quad\iff\quad \text{dim }V +
            \text{ht}(I(V)) = n.\]
        </li>
        <li>
            Since \(f\) is irreducible, we have that the ideal generated by \(f\) is a prime ideal, denoted by \(\langle
            f\rangle\).
            <br><br>
            <em class="NTS">It remains to show:</em> \(\text{ht}(\langle f\rangle) = 1\).
            <br><br>
            Note that since \(f \neq 0\), we have that \(\text{ht}(\langle f\rangle) \geq 1\).
            <br><br>
            For the other direction, let \(\langle 0\rangle \subsetneq \mathfrak{p} \subsetneq \langle f\rangle\) be a
            chain of prime ideals, \(h \in \mathfrak{p} \setminus \{0\}\) and \(h = h_1\cdot \ldots \cdot h_r\)
            a prime decomposition.
            Since \(h \in \langle f\rangle\), there is an index \(i \in \{1, \ldots, r\}\) with \(h_i \in \langle
            f\rangle\).
            This implies that \(h_i = f \cdot g\) for a unit \(g \in k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]\), thus \(g \in k^\times\).
            But then, \(f \in \mathfrak{p}\), implying \(\mathfrak{p} = \langle f\rangle\), which shows that the chain
            \(\langle 0\rangle \subsetneq \langle f\rangle\) is already maximal.
            <br><br>
            Hence, \(\text{ht}(\langle f\rangle) = 1\), which concludes the proof.
